\f0\fs24 \cf0 My website was created using HTML and CSS. To begin, I built an HTML outline using standard practice.  Everything was organized by making use of divs, classes and IDs. This was important, because through this process I learned the importance of unique and precise naming for divs and classes.  I also discovered that I could use a piece of css for multiple elements across the pages if I made them the same structure in HTML;  doing this saved me from repeating myself too much. Following this I began styling my website with CSS. I was able to use flex box to a greater extent than I have in the past. I also linked pages and PDFs within the site, which is also relatively new to me. I was also excited to incorporate a favicon into my HTML. It was satisfying to see my design come to life in a responsive way across all of the website layouts. Through this process I learned more about troubleshooting the various code errors that I came across, and I was also able to make use of the inspect tool in both Chrome and Firefox. THE END.  \
